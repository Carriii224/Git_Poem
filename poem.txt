"She Is the Storm and the Shelter"

2025.5.6 as the first day

She walks with thunder in her bones,
A hush of fire in her eyes—
The kind of calm that splits the sky
Before the lightning dares to rise.

She does not ask the world for space,
She becomes the world instead—
With roots that twist through ash and flame,
And dreams too loud to leave unsaid.

She cradles joy in calloused hands,
Turns pain to poems, scars to grace—
Her voice a tide, both gentle and vast,
That time itself would not erase.
But when the world forgets her worth,
He sings her back into her throne.

She is the mountain and the stream,
The sword, the wound, the healing seam—
A breath of dusk, a blaze of dawn,
A force that keeps the dark withdrawn.
